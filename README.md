==========

Marmalade sample projects to get you started with 2D game development using the Marmalade SDK.
These example projects accompany the [Easy 2D using the Marmalade SDK](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com) blog.

Getting started with Marmalade
------------------------------
* Download the latest SDK release [here](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/download).
* If you've already got the SDK but haven't registered you can [register here](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/user/register).
* On OS X you will need Xcode 5.0 or greater.  You can download this from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
* On Windows you will need Visual Studio. We recommend Visual Studio Express 2010 which can be downloaded [here](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709949), however any version of Visual Studio 2008-2012 is compatible with Marmalade.
